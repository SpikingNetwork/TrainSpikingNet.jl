#=
the genPlasticWeights plugin defines the connectivity of the learned synapses.
this file is the default, and for each neuron simply chooses a random 2*L as
presynaptic partners and sets their initial weights to predefined values.
=#

#=
this is the sole plugin to input a variable other than just the user-defined
arguments.  specifically, it also inputs the number of spikes generated by the
static connectivity alone (called ns0 in the code).
returned are three matrices and a vector specifying the plastic connectivity.
the first returned matrix (called wpWeightX in the source code) is
Ncells x LX and contains the (initial) weights of the feed forward
presynaptic neurons.
the second (wpWeightIn, Ncells columns) and third (wpIndexIn, Ncells rows)
matrices contain the weights and indices of the recurrent presynaptic
neurons.
the final returned variable is a vector of length Ncells (ncpIn) which
specifies how many presynaptic connections each neuron has.
