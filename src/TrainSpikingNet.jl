using .Param

"""
    param(data_dir) -> (; Ncells, dt, etc.)

Evaluate the "param.jl" file in the directory `data_dir` and save the
required variables into "params.jld2" in the same directory.  The latter
is also returned as a NamedTuple as a convenience, for manual inspection,
but is not required by any other functions as they read directly from the
JLD2 file.

This function only needs to be called once when "param.jl" is created or
modified, or the seed of the random generator is `nothing` and a different
set of connections and weights is desired.
"""
param

"""
    config(data_dir, pu::Symbol=:cpu)

Load the code required to initialize, train, and test the model in `data_dir`
using the hardware specified by `pu`.  The latter can either be `:cpu`
or `:gpu`.

`param` must be called before `config`, and `config` must be called once
in each fresh session of Julia before `init`, `train`, and `test`.
"""
config

"""
    init(; itasks=[1], utarg_file=nothing, spikerate_file=nothing) -> (; weights, etc)

Generate the adjacency matrices and populate the weights according to the
plugins provided in "param.jl" for the model specified in the last call to
`config`.  The data are saved to JLD2 files in the `data_dir` input to the
last call to `config`, and are read by `train`.  They are also returned as
a NamedTuple for easier manual inspection.

`param` and `config` must be called before `init`, the former in any
julia session and the latter in the current session.  `init` only needs
to be called once when "param.jl" is created or modified or the seed of
the random generator is `nothing` and a different set of connections and
weights is desired.

            monitor_resources_used = nothing,
            return_P = false) -> (; weights, P)

Update the weights using the recursive least squares algorithm `nloops`
times, measuring the similarity between the actual and target synaptic
currents every `correlation_interval` iterations.  To continue training
a previous model, specify which of the saved weights to start from with
`restore_from_checkpoint`.  The learned plastic weights and updated covariance
matrix are saved as JLD2 files in the `data_dir` input to the last call to
`config` with the checkpoint added as a suffix.  The weights and optionally
the covariance are also returned as a NamedTuple for convenience.

Keeping the weights frozen, evaluate the model `ntrials` times and
save the spike times and presynaptic currents of the neurons indexed as
`ineurons_to_test` to "test.jld2" in the `data_dir` input to the last call
to `config`.  These data are also returned as a NamedTuple for convenience.
`plot` is immediately called on the results unless `no_plot` is `true`.
"""
test

"""
    plot(test_file; ineurons_to_plot = 1:16)

Plot cumulative peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) and averaged
presynaptic currents for the neurons indexed as `ineurons_to_plot`
in the JLD2 file specified in `test_file`.  Output PDFs are named
"test-{psth,syninput}-task{N}.pdf" are saved in the the same directory as
`test_file`.
